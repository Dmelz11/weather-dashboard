# Weather Dashboard

## This repo is for the weather dashboard, Module 06 Challenge. Which will create a weather dashboard the makes API calls to openweathermap.org to fecth the current weather and a five day forecast. The weather dashboard will also show the date using the unix timestamp and store data in local storage.

## I have really enjoyed working on this challenge, because I've learn quite a bit of important skills on this. The API calls, using a more dynamic approach to the page, thanks to my tutor who must say has taught me so much! Very exciting explanations of writing the proper paths needed to create my variables. Better use of the inspection tools. It goes on and on, very good. Trinh Nguyen...extremely helpful tutor! I was not used to using the jass.css and it kind of distracted me a bit. I also used some bootstrap for the html which I also needed to delete so much of that. Besides the challenges this was a great project thaat taught me alot. I know it's not quite done yet and I plan on more improvements in regards to the local storage. I want to submit this and try and catch up with my other challenges which I've begun working on and I'm getting really into as far as the node.js goes. Again super exciting learning happening right now!
